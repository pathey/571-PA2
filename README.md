PA #2

SJF.c is the shortest job first implementation, FCFS.c is the first come first serve implementation, and MLFQ.c is the multi-level feedback queue implementation.

To compile all programs run "make all". Warnings are intended to be suppressed, but had trouble implementing.

You can also run "make clean" to clear executables.

To run a given file type "run\_\[PROGRAM NAME\]" but replace PROGRAM NAME with the name of the program excluding the ".c" suffix.
